Each stroller I purchased, I felt it was perfect...that perfect lasted a few short months. I was a big britax fan having the b-ready (felt it was too big and sold it) then purchasing the b-agile.I really like the b-safe infant car seat and hesitated giving up my b-agile because of the snap and go compatibility, however now being compatitible with Britax I decided to sell my b-agile and buy the CM.B-Agile and City Mini GT are very similar but for me there were two big differences1. although looks the same, the CM basket is larger and accessible from the side. Makes a huge difference when trying to get things in and out.2. Adjustable handle barThese two points above have made all the difference between the b-agile and CM. I love the CM and would definitely recommend it to a friend. I also find having the forever tires,  its sturdier than the b-agile and is slightly heavier as well.Worth the extra money- you got my vote!!\n"
